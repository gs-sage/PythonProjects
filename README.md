# PythonProjects 🐍

A learning repo where I practice Python fundamentals, problem-solving, and small projects (including my first Django app).  
This is intentionally hands-on: short scripts, focused exercises, and incremental improvements as I learn.

---

## What you’ll find here

This repo is organized by topic so I can quickly revisit concepts and track progress:

- **Fundamentals**: variables, data types, strings, conditionals
- **Core Python**: lists/tuples, dictionaries/sets, loops, functions, recursion
- **File I/O**: reading/writing files + practice exercises
- **OOP**: classes, inheritance, constructors, basic design
- **HackerRank practice**: problem-solving reps and patterns
- **Django (beginner)**: my first Django project/app setup
