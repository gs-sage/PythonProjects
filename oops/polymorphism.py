"""Polymorphism
When the same operator is allowed to have different meaning according to the context.
Good example in python for polymorphism is the operator overloading"""

print(1+2) # prints 3
print("Name" + " your college") # concatenates two strings
print([1,2,3] + [4,5,6]) # merges list

"""The above examples are called implicit overloading since the classes for them have
already been defined in python."""
